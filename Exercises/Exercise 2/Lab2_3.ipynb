    "Continuing from the outcome of the previous assignment, we want to calculate different types of information based on the routes of users. The column trip_id denotes locations that a certain user has gone through. As such, a unique user (i.e ID=1) has gone through different locations. To do the calculations for this, we will need to use the trip_id column of the data set ***sweden_points.shp*** that we created at the last step of Assignment 2.\n",
