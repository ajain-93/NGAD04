    "# Assertions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assertions** are a language feature in Python that enable programmers to verify that a certain condition is met. This feature is particularly useful for ensuring that variables are within an appropriate range, or having the right type for further analysis. For example, in a function that converts temperatures, an assertion can be used to check that the input value is not below absolute zero or if that input is of type float or integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, `assert` statements function similarly to an electrical fuse: if the input current is too high, the fuse blows to protect the appliance that follows. Likewise, if input values are outside an expected range, the `assert` statement triggers an error, halting the program to prevent subsequent code from running with incorrect inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assertions are commonly utilized within functions to verify that input values are within acceptable bounds and sometimes part of the exercises so that the examiners (or yourself) can assess check that your code works as expected. Here's an example:\n",

    "**However**, it's worth noting that there are better, faster, and more elegant solutions available that are also more concise. One such example is the use of the `apply()` method in Pandas' `DataFrame`s.

Setting `axis=1` applies the function across rows.\n",

    "### Applying a Lambda Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For straightforward functions that are concise enough to fit in a single line, it's possible to utilize what's known as a *lambda function* or *lambda notation*. Lambda functions adhere to the syntax `lambda arguments: return-value`, which involves the `lambda` keyword followed by one or more argument names (separated by commas), a colon (`:`), and the expression defining the return value. For instance, a lambda function that takes two arguments and returns their sum would be written as `lambda a, b: (a + b)`.\n",

    "These lambda functions are useful for their brevity and are meant to be used directly where they're defined, providing a convenient way to incorporate simple expressions without the need for defining separate functions.

As a general guideline, lambda functions are best reserved for cases where the code can comfortably fit on one (short) line.\n",
